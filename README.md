# Notion-Countdown-Timer
This project offers a countdown timer that utilizes the Youtube API Sound Player, making it embeddable into Notion pages via [Apption.co](https://apption.co/embeds/965d7809). Users can easily set timers ranging from 5 minutes to 60 minutes and more to enjoy the convenience of a sound alarm upon completion.
